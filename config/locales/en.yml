#        # Append your own errors here or at the model/attributes scope.

      # For example,

      # Will define custom blank validation message for User model and
      # custom blank validation message for login attribute of User model.


    # Translate model names. Used in Model.human_name().
    #models:
      # For example,
      #   user: "Dude"
      # will translate User model name to "Dude"

    # Translate model attribute names. Used in Model.human_attribute_name(attribute).
    #attributes:
      # For example,
      #   user:
      #     login: "Handle"
      # will translate User attribute "login" as "Handle"
